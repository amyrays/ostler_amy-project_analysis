			<h1>Site Intent</h1>
			<p>Spring Lake Elementary is an A+ public school utilizing top-notch technologies. The schools current site struggles to communicate important messages and dates effectively. Spring Lake Elementary has asked that I, Amy Ostler, design and develop an up-to-date website that is functional and easy to use.</p>
			<p>By reducing the current 21 pages of content to only 6 pages of content, reorganizing and restructuring the content, designing and developing to meet W3C standards, and using proper Information Architecture we can increase load times and gain our targeted audiences attention.</p>
